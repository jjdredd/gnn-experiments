* Edge detection as object detection experiment
 This is an experiment to detect graph edges using an object detector.
** Start with a yolo11 model (no pretraining)
may try v 8 but 9 or 10 are not recommended, yolo11n is smaller
** Make 3 classes of edges:
*** slanted like y=x
*** slanted like y=-x
*** vertical
*** horizontal
** Bounding box center is now the edge center
** Bounding box width and height are either
*** absolute values of edge half vector
a vector from edge center to edge vertex
*** or just same bounding box width and height
