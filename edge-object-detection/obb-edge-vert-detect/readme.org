* OBB detection for edges and vertices
** Motivation
If we can detect walls and vertices with oriented bounding box, we can
get balance (potentially) and wall width.
** yolo oriented bounding boxes

*** [[https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/obb/][Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) Datasets Overview]]
** Other modifications/considerations:
*** New graph generation algorithm
The old graph generation based on networkx generator functions and embeddings
does not give a good graph, especially for variable wall width
we use the voronoi polygon/graph generation using shapely
